GW Security Documentation 

This page is supoused to work as a example of an FTP to host gw security manuals, firmware, software as well as errata and sugestions easily editable. 

## Why FTP, Markdown and repositories ? 

### Markdown as an alternative of excel spreadsheets 

Not for everything but at least for official documentation either for customers or employees it could help to have quicker(to load), easier to edit and ultimately to update. 

As well as realiable, everything that you can read was did just with a simple syntax: 

```
### Small Titles
## Medium Size
# And Large
```

### Small Titles
## Medium Size
# And Large

The point is that having simpler text files is easier to find information, less prompt to corrupt and easier to modify. 

- You can also make more complex things like, bullets tables or [hyperlinks](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
